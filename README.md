# albyp nvim config
This is my custom nvim config designed to be lightweight and full-featured.
Easy to clone to any machine.

Heavily inspired by [Neovim-from-scratch](https://github.com/lunarvim/neovim-from-scratch).

## Installing the config
Make sure to remove or backup your current `nvim` directory
`cd` into the nvim directory
```sh
git clone https://github.com/albyp/nvim-config.git .
```

## Todo
